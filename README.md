API-Status
==========

A Mac menu bar app that sends a request every 15 minutes to the RESTful web API of your choice and displays a meter and time in ms for the response.

If you just want the compiled app to run on your system, it can be found in the "Compiled App" folder.

Unsure what the fields in app's preferences mean?  See the documentation for the iOS federal SDK documentation at http://developer.dol.gov/sdk-documentation/ios-gov-data-sdk as this is what is used by the app.
